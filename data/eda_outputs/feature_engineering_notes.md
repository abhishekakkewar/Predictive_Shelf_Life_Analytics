# Feature Engineering: Predictive Shelf Life Analytics

## Step Overview
Feature engineering transforms raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to predictive models, improving accuracy and interpretability.

## Steps Performed
- **Product Age:** Calculated as days since manufacturing, providing a direct measure of product freshness.
- **One-hot Encoding:** Converted the categorical 'Product' column into binary columns for each product type, enabling use in machine learning models.
- **Interaction Feature:** Created a new feature by multiplying storage temperature and humidity, capturing their combined effect on shelf life.

## Architecture/Workflow
- **Input:** `synthetic_shelf_life_data.csv` (raw synthetic data)
- **Process:** Feature engineering script adds new features and encodes categorical variables
- **Output:** `processed_shelf_life_data.csv` (ready for modeling)

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Feature Selection:** Choosing features that are both predictive and interpretable
- **Avoiding Data Leakage:** Ensuring no future information is used in feature creation
- **Business Interpretability:** Features should make sense to business stakeholders
- **Scalability:** The process should be easily extendable to new data or features
