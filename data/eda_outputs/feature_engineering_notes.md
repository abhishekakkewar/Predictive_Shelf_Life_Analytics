# Advanced Feature Engineering: Predictive Shelf Life Analytics

## Step Overview
Advanced feature engineering transforms raw data into highly informative features that capture domain knowledge, business logic, and complex relationships to improve model performance and interpretability.

## Advanced Features Created

### 1. Time-Based Features
- **Product_Age:** Days since manufacturing (existing)
- **Day_of_Week:** Day of week (0-6) for manufacturing date
- **Month:** Manufacturing month (1-12)
- **Season:** Season classification (1-4)
- **Is_Weekend:** Binary flag for weekend manufacturing

### 2. Environmental Risk Scores
- **Temp_Risk_Score:** Risk score based on temperature exceeding 10°C
- **Humidity_Risk_Score:** Risk score based on humidity exceeding 70%
- **Environmental_Risk:** Combined environmental risk score

### 3. Product-Specific Features
- **Is_Dairy:** Binary flag for dairy products (Yogurt, Milk, Cheese)
- **Shelf_Life_Category:** Categorical classification (Short: 0-14 days, Medium: 15-30 days, Long: 31-60 days)
- **Age_Ratio:** Ratio of product age to initial shelf life

### 4. Interaction Features
- **Temp_Humidity_Interaction:** Temperature × Humidity
- **Temp_Transit_Interaction:** Temperature × Days in Transit
- **Humidity_Transit_Interaction:** Humidity × Days in Transit
- **Age_Temp_Interaction:** Product Age × Temperature

### 5. Statistical Features
- **Temp_Z_Score:** Standardized temperature (how far from mean)
- **Humidity_Percentile:** Percentile rank of humidity values

### 6. Business Logic Features
- **High_Temp_Flag:** Binary flag for temperature > 12°C
- **High_Humidity_Flag:** Binary flag for humidity > 75%
- **Long_Transit_Flag:** Binary flag for transit > 5 days
- **Risk_Level:** Categorical risk classification (Low, Medium, High)

### 7. Categorical Encoding
- **One-hot encoding** for Product, Shelf_Life_Category, and Risk_Level

## Architecture/Workflow
- **Input:** `synthetic_shelf_life_data.csv` (raw synthetic data)
- **Process:** Advanced feature engineering script with domain knowledge integration
- **Output:** `processed_shelf_life_data.csv` (feature-rich data ready for modeling)

## Business Value of New Features
- **Risk Assessment:** Environmental risk scores help identify high-risk products
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Time-based features capture seasonal effects on shelf life
- **Product Intelligence:** Product-specific features differentiate between product types
- **Operational Insights:** Business logic features flag critical conditions
- **Statistical Robustness:** Z-scores and percentiles handle outliers and extreme values

## Model Performance Impact
- **Increased Feature Count:** From ~11 to ~25+ features
- **Better Interpretability:** Business-friendly features (risk scores, flags)
- **Improved Accuracy:** Complex interactions and domain knowledge
- **Robust Predictions:** Statistical features handle data variability

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Feature Selection:** More features require careful selection to avoid overfitting
- **Domain Expertise:** Features require food safety and logistics knowledge
- **Data Quality:** Statistical features depend on data distribution quality
- **Maintenance:** Business logic features need updates as thresholds change
