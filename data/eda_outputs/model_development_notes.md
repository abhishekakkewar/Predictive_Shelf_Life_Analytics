# Model Development: Predictive Shelf Life Analytics

## Step Overview
Model development involves training and evaluating machine learning models to predict the remaining shelf life of products based on engineered features and environmental factors.

## Steps Performed
- **Data Preparation:** Used processed data with engineered features
- **Train-Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing for unbiased evaluation
- **Model Selection:** Trained both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor
- **Evaluation:** Compared models using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics
- **Model Saving:** Saved the best-performing model and evaluation metrics for deployment and reporting

## Architecture/Workflow
- **Input:** `processed_shelf_life_data.csv` (feature-engineered data)
- **Process:** Model training and evaluation script
- **Output:** Trained model file (`models/`), evaluation metrics (`models/model_evaluation_metrics.csv`)

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Selection:** Balancing interpretability (Linear Regression) and performance (Random Forest)
- **Overfitting/Underfitting:** Ensuring the model generalizes well to new data
- **Metric Selection:** Using multiple metrics for a comprehensive evaluation
- **Reproducibility:** Saving models and metrics for future use and validation
